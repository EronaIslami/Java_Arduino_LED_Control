Java-Arduino-LED-Control, features a project that leverages Java and Arduino to create a Human Machine Interface (HMI) for LED control.
This interface allows users to send commands ('H' for ON, 'L' for OFF) from a Java application to an Arduino, which then controls the state of an LED using the jSerialComm library for serial communication.
